### About

I am a software engineer with a background in mathematics. My approach to engineering is grounded in logic, efficiency, and precision. I treat code optimization like solving a variable equation—finding the most elegant solution to complex problems.

- Building **[socketio-multiroom-chat](https://github.com/infinawaz/socketio-multiroom-chat)** — A real-time communication platform.
- Exploring **Abstract Algebra** and its applications in **Computer Science**.

**Languages**  
Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL

**Full Stack**  
React, Node.js, Express, FastAPI, HTML5, CSS3

**Tools & Infrastructure**  
Docker, Git, Linux, SQLite, Postman
